- Added `analyze_monetization_opportunities` pattern to map audience intent to revenue strategies, covering affiliate links, sponsorships, and digital products.
- Registered all three new patterns in `pattern_descriptions.json` and `pattern_extracts.json` with appropriate metadata and tags.

### PR [#2086](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Fabric/pull/2086) by [majiayu000](https://github.com/majiayu000): fix: parse vendor prefix from model name for vendor/model convention

- **Fix:** Added fallback logic to parse the vendor prefix from a model name when no vendor is explicitly specified. When a model string such as `ollama/llama3` is passed, the lookup no longer fails with a "could not find vendor" error; instead, the first path segment is split and checked against known vendors, correctly resolving the model to `llama3` under the `Ollama` vendor group.

## v1.4.450 (2026-04-23)

### PR [#2092](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Fabric/pull/2092) by [Resistor52](https://github.com/Resistor52): feat(openai): add GrokAI search grounding via xAI Responses API

- Added support for GrokAI search grounding via xAI's Responses API, fixing HTTP 422 errors caused by a hardcoded OpenAI `web_search_preview` tool name in `buildResponseParams`.
- Introduced two new fields to `openai_compatible.ProviderConfig`: `WebSearchToolName` (to override the default web search tool name) and `EnableXSearch` (to append xAI's `x_search` tool when search is enabled).
- Both new fields default to empty/false, preserving full backwards compatibility for all existing providers.
- GrokAI is pre-configured with `WebSearchToolName` set to `"web_search"` and `EnableXSearch` set to `true`, enabling grounded search results with real source URLs via `fabric -V GrokAI --search`.
- Added tests in `openai_test.go` covering the new override paths and confirming default provider behavior remains unchanged.

## v1.4.438 (2026-03-18)

### PR [#2061](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Fabric/pull/2061) by [praxstack](https://github.com/praxstack): fix(chat): prevent streaming deadlock and unify strategy handling

- **Fixed a streaming deadlock in `Chatter.Send`** by introducing `recordFirstStreamError()`, which uses a non-blocking `select/default` to safely send only the first error to the buffered error channel, preventing goroutine leaks when both the `SendStream` goroutine and the stream-update loop attempt to write simultaneously.
- **Unified strategy handling across the CLI and REST API server** by passing `StrategyName` through to `GetChatter()` and `ChatRequest`, ensuring the core `Chatter.BuildSession()` layer handles strategy loading consistently instead of duplicating logic in the server handler.
- **Removed inline `os.ReadFile` strategy loading from the server handler**, which previously bypassed the core Chatter layer, causing strategy prompts to be incorrectly prepended to `UserInput` rather than the system message.
- **Replaced raw string concatenation for system message assembly** with a new `joinPromptSections()` helper that trims whitespace, skips empty sections, and joins strategy, context, and pattern prompts with a single newline separator.
- **Added regression and unit tests**, including a 2-second timeout deadlock test (`TestChatter_Send_StreamingErrorUpdateAndReturnDoesNotDeadlock`), a session-assembly validation test (`TestChatter_BuildSession_SeparatesSystemSections`), and a helper verification test (`TestBuildPromptChatRequest_PreservesStrategyAndUserInput`).

- Added dynamic Bedrock region fetching from `botocore`'s `endpoints.json`, expanding support to 40+ regions instead of a hardcoded list of 6, with a static fallback on error.
- Fixed `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable conflict that caused `'failed to get shared config profile'` errors for users who had `AWS_PROFILE` set for other tools (e.g., Terraform, AWS CLI) while using explicit access keys or static credentials.
- Improved empty auth choice handling to gracefully skip the selection instead of throwing an error.
